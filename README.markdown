About
=====

This is a Java implementation of the Blizzard World of Warcraft API published
at [http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/](http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/).

This API follows the DAO pattern for access to the API. It uses simple POJOs for entity modelling.

There are a number of Junit tests that test the parsing of the resulting JSON. In order to run the tests, you will need
the [http://mockito.org/](Mockito) mock library. This is not needed to use the API, just for testing. Anything in the
test hierarchy is not needed to use the API. It includes pre-generated JSON responses from the API to speed up testing
and to just test the JSON parsing and not require a network connection to run the tests.

Dependencies
============

* [http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/](Google Gson) is required to use this API. The allows the parsing of JSON
directly into Java objects.

* [http://mockito.org/](Mockito) for unit testing

The argument checking code was taken from [http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/](Google Guava) but since I didn't
use anything else I just copied that directly.
